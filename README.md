# nu-blox
nuBlox - [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) based content builder.
Written primarily for [nuCms](https://github.com/nugato/nuCMS), but you can also integrate it with other software.

More specifically, it's not a typical content builder. nuBlox returns JSON file which contains information about the structure of HTML elements.

## Developing

install dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
``` bash
npm run dev
```

build for production with minification
``` bash
npm run build
```

## Integrations

soon ;)
